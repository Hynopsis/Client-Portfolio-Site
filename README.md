# Client-Portfolio-Site
This was a small intership project I worked on.  All pages were designed from scratch with a focus on simplicity.  It is completely responsive and scalable using Bootstrap and media queries, so should look pretty good on a computer, phone, or tablet.  The contact for does work if on a php enabled server.  The link to the site is http://www.rpetersen4.btcwsd.com/vbc/, and the link to the older site is http://www.vanderbloemencreative.com/.
